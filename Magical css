  ption of strict liability torts. For instance, liability in the torts of negligence, occupier’s liability, professional negligence, road traffic accidents, etc are based on the principle of fault or negligence.

Generally, a vital ingredient in constituting a tort is legal damage. In order to prove an action for tort in the court, the plaintiff has to prove that there was a wrongful act or an act or omission which resulted in the breach of a legal duty or the violation of a legal right. So, there must be a violation of a legal right of a person and if there is no violation of a legal right then there can be no action under the law of torts. If there has been a violation of a legal right, the same is actionable whether the plaintiff has suffered any loss or not. This is expressed by the maxim, “Injuria sine damno” where ‘Injuria’ refers to “infringement of the legal right of a person” and the term ‘damnum’ means “substantial harm, loss or damage to that individual”. The term ‘sine’ means “without”. However, if there is no violation of a legal right, no action can lie in a court despite of the loss, harm or damage to the plaintiff caused by the defendant. 
In summary, each kind of tort has its own rules of liability. However, the rules which determine liability in various torts include the following:
1.	The principle of fault or negligence 
Liability in many torts is based on the principle of negligence or existence of fault, with the exception of strict liability torts. For instance, liability in the torts of negligence, occupier’s liability, professional negligence, road traffic accidents, etc are based on the principle of fault or negligence.
